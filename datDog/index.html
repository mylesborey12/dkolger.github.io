                    Does the idea of a hot dog put a smile on your face? Does it remind you of happy times at a
                        picnic, a ballpark, or on vacation? could an Irish Guinness sausage with andouille sauce,
                        onions, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon and yellow mustard resurrect those positive vibes?
                        Then you understand the reason Dat Dog was opened in a 475 sq. ft. shack in a post Katrina
                        New Orleans neighborhood on February 14, 2011.
